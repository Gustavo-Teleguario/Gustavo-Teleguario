### 🚀 About Me
Originally from Guatemala, I have consciously advanced my professional career in Germany. Over the past few years, I have gained extensive practical experience during my computer science studies as a working student—spanning areas such as IT support, software development and SAP environments. My focus has not only been on technical aspects but also on actively collaborating with people, where I have successfully utilized my empathy, communication skills, and solution-oriented approach.

What excites me most is software development. I have independently conceived and developed my own projects, which has allowed me to deepen my passion for this field. Currently, I am expanding my knowledge in developing with Microservices, RESTful Web Services (API), and both front-end and back-end development in Java.

I am enthusiastic about continuous learning and am always looking for new challenges and opportunities to grow as a developer.
